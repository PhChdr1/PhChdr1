## Hi there 👋

I’m PhChdr, a Computer Science engineering student at ESIEE Paris, currently in the final year of a 3-year apprenticeship program leading to an MS in Computer Science.

I alternate academic training with industry experience, working on real-world engineering projects involving software development, systems, networking, and security.

My main technical stack includes Java (advanced 25+), C, Python, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React.

I primarily work with IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code, and regularly use Figma/Photoshop and Blender for visual and prototyping needs.

I have several pinned projects showcasing my work across software, systems, and engineering topics.

If you’re interested in how I design and build my projects, additional learning resources and materials are available here.
